    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>
      Eagle Transport Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing assistance to underserved communities. Currently a very small non-profit based out of Salt Lake City, UT. We hope to expand and help as much Americans as we can. Our non-profit started after a few taxi drivers, rideshare drivers and transportation drivers got together and discussed ways to help people that we have seen suffer due to not being able to get to a medical facility.

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      Millions of Americans in United States go without medical care due to lacking transportation. Those millions is representative of all of us living in America regardless of race, age, gender, and employment status. They could be your neighbors, friends or someone you just met at the supermarket. 

      Our mission is to make transportation the least of their worries. Operating out of Salt Lake City, UT we hope to help our communities by making them healthier. We also hope that our mission starts a movement based off kindness.
